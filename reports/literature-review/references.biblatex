  abstract = {This paper investigates monostatic RCS measurement results of a typical car as a complex object using an FMCW automotive radar to determine the backscattering behavior of the target. The backscattering behavior can be modeled by identifying the scattering centers of the target. In a subsequent step, the extracted scattering centers can be used for the simulation of the millimeter wave automotive radar channel in realistic scenarios. These scenarios can be simulated by a comprehensive system simulation environment according to asymptotic ray-based methods. The used ray-tracing tool showed a good estimation of communication channels, however for radar channels, that relies primarily on backscattering effects, its accuracy is strongly dependent on the scattering behavior of the targets. The integration of highly resolved CAD models into the ray-tracing software results in a high computational effort. In many cases, the exact CAD model of a car or other traffic participants is not even available. So, one solution for minimizing the computational effort is to determine the scattering centers of complex objects and to identify the most significant ones. Based on these relevant scattering centers a simplified model can be created. For this purpose, some measurement campaigns have been performed in a realistic stationary environment to investigate the spatially resolved scattering behavior of a car.},

This method allows optimization of the beampattern by altering the cross-correlation matrix of the transmitted waveforms. The optimization is based on minimization of a cost function, but the use of numerical methods in the algorithm leads to high computational complexity. Here we propose a new cost function for the beampattern optimization. For linear arrays and typical beampatterns, this cost function can be evaluated in closed form, thus reducing the computational complexity considerably. Simulation examples demonstrate that the proposed cost function also leads to faster convergence and lower approximation error.},

The proposed subarray is, for the first time, loaded with stacked micro-vias (SMVs). Two sets of patches in the subarray are fed 180° out-of-phase. A low-cost, high-resolution multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) technology, called “any-layer PCB,” is used to implement the SMVs, which cannot be done by standard high-definition interconnect PCB technology. Moreover, the technology supports small SMVs on different layers; hence, thick machine-drilled vias can be avoided. For comparison, a series-fed patch subarray with no SMV loading is designed. It is shown that SMV loading facilitates a larger overlap of the impedance and gain bandwidths, leading to a larger operating bandwidth. The measured 10 dB impedance and 3 dB gain bandwidths are 15\% and 9.6\%, respectively. The sidelobe suppression is above 12.9 dB, and the maximum array gain is 12.67 dBi at 79.1 GHz. This subarray is suitable for MIMO radar, as its width is around half-wavelength and the SMVs around it mitigate the crosstalk between the transmitting and receiving arrays.},

Different types of automotive radar as well as mechanisms and characteristics of interference and the effects of interference on radar system performance are described. The interference-to-noise ratio (INR) at the output of a detector is a measure of the susceptibility of a radar to interference. The INR is derived from different types of interfering and victim radars and depends on the location of both as well as parameters such as transmit power, antenna gain, and bandwidth. In addition, for victim radar with beamscanning, INR depends on the location of the target the victim radar is attempting to detect. Analysis is presented to show the effects of various interference scenarios on the INR. A review of the current state of the art in interference mitigation techniques previously deployed as well as areas of research currently being addressed is then provided. Finally, important future research directions are suggested.},

  abstract = {A high-gain millimeter-wave patch array antenna is presented for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For the large-scale patch array antenna, microstrip lines and higher-mode surface wave radiations contribute enormously to the antenna loss, especially at the millimeter-wave band. Here, the element of a large patch array antenna is implemented with a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity-backed patch fed by the aperture-coupled feeding (ACF) structure. However, in this case, a large coupling aperture is used to create strongly bound waves, which maximizes the coupling level between the patch and the feedline. This approach helps to improve antenna gain, but at the same time leads to a significant level of back radiation due to the microstrip feedline and unwanted surface-wave radiation, especially for the large patch arrays. Using the SIW cavity-backed patch and stripline feedline of the ACF in the element design, therefore, provides a solution to this problem. Thus, a full-corporate feed 32 × 32 array antenna achieves realized gain of 30.71–32.8 dBi with radiation efficiency above 52\% within the operational band of 25.43–26.91 GHz. The fabricated antenna also retains being lightweight, which is desirable for UAVs, because it has no metal plate at the backside to support the antenna.},

  abstract = {Millimeter-Wave (mm-W) is considered a potential technology for high-data rate wireless transmission and for high-resolution short-range radar, due to the 7–9 GHz bandwidth at the 60 GHz unlicensed band available worldwide. Developing ultrawideband architectures including multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems at mm-W offer many advantages including jointly optimized analogue and digital signal processing at carrier frequency and baseband. This allows for flexible antenna designs and reduced losses, as many passive structures can be avoided at both sides of the link. Besides, based on flexible polarimetric approaches, the polarimetric propagation of electromagnetic waves can be exploited. In this paper we present a 60 GHz polarimetric MIMO system architecture, which includes analogue miniaturized frontends designed and manufactured by multi-layer packaging technologies. Such architecture permitted the design of compact MIMO radar and multi-dimensional channel sounding. The MIMO approach allows not only polarimetric filtering and fully polarimetric/directional signal processing to increase the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio of mm-W radar systems, but also the full characterization of wireless channels including multipath with orthogonal polarizations.},

The antenna geometry included two metallic plates with extended hook-shaped strips at its principal diagonal position, and two corners of truncated metallic plates at the secondary diagonal position. The pair of metallic vias connected the modified strips to the ground plane to create the magnetic dipole. The L-shaped probe feed between the strips was used to excite the antenna. The antenna showed stable gain and wideband characteristics. The simulated and measured results showed that the proposed CP ME dipole antenna had an overlapping (|S11|{$<$} −10 dB impedance and 3 dB axial ratio) bandwidth of 18.1\% (25–30 GHz), covering the frequency bands dedicated for 5G new radio communications. Moreover, an average gain of 8 dBic was achieved by the antenna throughout the operating bandwidth. The measured data verified the design concept, and the proposed antenna had a small footprint of 0.83 λo × 0.83 λo × 0.125 λo (λo is free space wavelength at the lowest operating frequency), suitable for its application in 5G smart devices and sensors.},

This has implications for the measured target detections of extended objects, such as vehicles, which cause complex backscatter signatures. Simulation-based approaches strive to enable efficient testing concepts, but require high-fidelity sensor models. To assess the impact of different sensors on the virtual replication of sensor data, it is important to examine the variations between measurements from various sensors. In this letter, radar detections of a passenger vehicle using three radars with different characteristics are presented. Similarities between the spatial distributions of the detections are revealed and differences in the number of target detections, and the accuracy of their localization within the bounding box of the vehicle are identified. Furthermore, the spatial fluctuations of point clouds between succeeding measurement cycles are investigated. The results suggest that existing data-driven modeling approaches can be applied to different sensors as well, but that particular attention must be paid to the distinct spatial spread of the detections and to the fluctuations of point clouds.},

  abstract = {An antenna concept for compact millimeter-wave radar sensors that desire a fan-beam radiation pattern is proposed. It combines an end-fire antenna on a ceramic substrate with a cylindrical parabolic reflector that can be integrated in the sensor's metal housing. The concept allows a direct interconnection from the active components to the antenna in a flip-chip attachment. It is validated with a 77-GHz Yagi-Uda antenna on a 127-mum thick Alumina substrate by measurements with a probe-based measurement setup. The measured return loss, gain, and radiation patterns of the antenna without and with the reflector are given.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new space-time coding configuration for target detection and localization by radar or sonar systems. In common active array systems, the transmitted signal is usually coherent between the different elements of the array. This configuration does not allow array processing in the transmit mode. However, space-time coding of the transmitted signals allows to digitally steer the beam pattern in the transmit in addition to the received signal. The ability to steer the transmitted beam pattern, helps to avoid beam shape loss. We show that the configuration with spatially orthogonal signal transmission is equivalent to additional virtual sensors which extend the array aperture with virtual spatial tapering. These virtual sensors can be used to form narrower beams with lower sidelobes and, therefore, provide higher performance in target detection, angular estimation accuracy, and angular resolution. The generalized likelihood ratio test for target detection and the maximum likelihood and Cramer-Rao bound for target direction estimation are derived for an arbitrary signal coherence matrix. It is shown that the optimal performance is achieved for orthogonal transmitted signals. Target detection and localization performances are evaluated and studied theoretically and via simulations},

  abstract = {Accurate environmental perception is a key requirement for autonomous driving. While the robust and precise estimation of the dynamic state of nearby objects is sufficient for ordinary driver assistance systems like adaptive cruise control, higher levels of autonomy require knowledge of the extent of objects for measurement data association and path finding algorithms. Extent estimation is known to be robustly accomplished by lidar sensors as they provide low measurement noise and a high resolution. Radar-based extent estimation, however, would be more cost-efficient if sufficient robustness would be given. In this work, we will examine the radar characteristics of vehicles using commercial off-the-shelf radars providing cluttered detection data, and evaluate its potential for extent estimation. This is done by observing measurement data from test vehicles with a known position from a spectrum of views, i.e. combinations of distances and orientations. We perform an appropriate measurement analysis and compare the obtainable extent estimate with the true contour. Besides, we consider radar-only vehicle features. The aim of this work is the acquisition of knowledge about typical radar reflection characteristics of vehicles employing a large data basis which can be subsequently utilized in online extent estimation algorithms.},

  abstract = {The fusion of multimodal sensor streams, such as camera, lidar, and radar measurements, plays a critical role in object detection for autonomous vehicles, which base their decision making on these inputs. While existing methods exploit redundant information in good environmental conditions, they fail in adverse weather where the sensory streams can be asymmetrically distorted. These rare “edge-case” scenarios are not represented in available datasets, and existing fusion architectures are not designed to handle them. To address this challenge we present a novel multimodal dataset acquired in over 10,000 km of driving in northern Europe. Although this dataset is the first large multimodal dataset in adverse weather, with 100k labels for lidar, camera, radar, and gated NIR sensors, it does not facilitate training as extreme weather is rare. To this end, we present a deep fusion network for robust fusion without a large corpus of labeled training data covering all asymmetric distortions. Departing from proposal-level fusion, we propose a single-shot model that adaptively fuses features, driven by measurement entropy. We validate the proposed method, trained on clean data, on our extensive validation dataset. Code and data are available here https://github.com/princeton-computational-imaging/SeeingThroughFog.},

  abstract = {Automotive radar is the most promising and fastest-growing civilian application of radar technology. Vehicular radars provide the key enabling technology for the autonomous driving revolution that will have a dramatic impact on everyone's day-to-day lives. They play a central role in the autonomous sensing suit because of the significant progress in the radio-frequency (RF) CMOS technology that enables high-level radar-on-chip integration and thus reduces the automotive radar cost to the level of consumer mass production. However, this would not be sufficient without high spatial resolution performance, which can be obtained by multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) and cognitive approaches at a lower cost. The uniqueness of automotive radar scenarios mandates the formulation and derivation of new signal processing approaches beyond classical military radar concepts. The reformulation of vehicular radar tasks, along with new performance requirements, provides an opportunity to develop innovative signal processing methods. In this article, we first revise conventional techniques for signal processing in automotive radar. Then, we emphasize the limitations of the historically driven conventional processing approaches in practical roadway scenarios and present alternative signal processing solutions. Finally, we propose several future research directions to enhance vehicular radar performance},

To apply the H\textbackslash alpha A decomposition to automotive radar data, a dedicated signal processing pipeline has been developed. To investigate its effectiveness, fully polarimetric measurements of surface scattering were performed in lab conditions as well as outdoors on actual road surface material under various conditions. A high-level analysis using the Euclidean distances between cluster centroids and the standard deviations of the H , \textbackslash alpha , and A features is performed, and it is shown that the proposed pipeline can provide an opportunity for classification of road surfaces, leading to enhanced road safety. Finally, the effect of neglecting the cross-polar components of the fully polarimetric measurements is considered. It is shown that in this case, the A feature cannot be used anymore. Despite this, the H and \textbackslash alpha features can still be used and several road surface conditions can still be distinguished from each other at the cost of less separation between the classes, thus leading to a trade-off between classification accuracy and radar system cost/complexity.},

The ME dipole is fed by a fork-shaped microstrip line coupling through a dog-bone slot. To meet the requirements aimed at automotive radar applications, the beamwidths of the proposed antenna are well-designed. Specially, a method of adding passive elements on both sides of the array is proposed to increase the 3 dB beamwidth from ±34° to ±52° in azimuth. Additionally, in elevation, a 3 dB beamwidth of ±10° is achieved by designing the spacing between array elements. Moreover, based on low-loss printed circuit board substrates, radiation efficiency of the proposed array can reach approximately 90\% at 77 GHz. Furthermore, a 4 × 4 array is established by arranging four 1 × 4 subarrays spacing 1.95 mm (half a free-space wavelength at 77 GHz) to study the interactions between subarrays for multiple input multiple output scenarios. A 1 × 4 and a 4 × 4 antenna prototypes are fabricated and measured to validate the correctness of this design.

Simultaneous feeding to both ports with proper amplitude and phase difference can result in radiated waves of arbitrary polarization. Owing to the circular array arrangement and the strong proximity coupling, the antenna exhibits a compact structure and achieves a high antenna efficiency of 90\% with seven patches.

The proposed array antenna uses a split-ring resonator as a radiating element coupled from a microstrip line. The split-ring resonator has the advantage of suppressing cross-polarization due to feed phase errors. To reduce the surface wave through the ground edges and enhance the beamwidth, we added the mushroom-shaped electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure. Amplitude tapering to reduce the SLL was implemented by adjusting the distance between each element and the microstrip line. The prototype SCSRRA antennas operating at 79 GHz were fabricated, and the characteristics of the wide fan-beam pattern and low SLL were experimentally verified.},

Each pixel is described by the scattering matrix corresponding to the emission/reception polarization states (usually horizontal and vertical). The algebraic real representation, a block symmetric matrix form, is introduced to adopt a more comprehensive framework (non-restricted by reciprocity assumptions) in mapping the scattering matrix by the consimilarity equivalence relation. The proposed representation can reveal potentially new information. For example, its eigenvalue decomposition, which is itself a necessary step in obtaining the consimilarity transformation products, may be useful in characterizing the degree of reciprocity/nonreciprocity. As a consequence, it can be employed in testing the reciprocity compliance assumed with monostatic PolSAR data.

  abstract = {Automated vehicles are becoming popular across the communities of e-transportation across the globe. Hybrid electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles have been subjected to critical research for decades. The research outcomes pertinent to this topic in the literature have been motivated by the industry and researchers to emphasize automated vehicles. Part 1 of this survey addressed the critical aspects that concern the bidirectional converter topologies and condition monitoring activities. In the present part, 24- and 77-GHz low-profile printed antennas are studied for automotive radar applications. These antennas are mounted on automated vehicles to avoid collision and are used for radio tracking applications. The present paper states the types of antenna structures, feed mechanisms, dielectric material requirements, design techniques, performance parameters, and challenges at 24- and 77-GHz resonating frequency applications. The recent developments in feed methodologies, beam scanning concepts, and the effect of sidelobe levels are addressed. Furthermore, the reasons behind the transition from 24 to 77 GHz are reported in detail. The recent advances in the application of various sensor schemes in an automated vehicle have also been discussed.},

Horizontal and vertical polarizations of the patch array are excited by the even and odd modes of the two microstrip lines, respectively.

The measured overlapping bandwidth of the two ports is 81 MHz, also with port isolation higher than 40 dB.

A (6/spl times/6) polarimetric coherency matrix is defined to simultaneously take into account the full polarimetric information from both images. This matrix is composed of the two coherency matrices and their cross-correlation. A decomposition theorem is applied to both images to obtain 64 initial clusters based on their scattering characteristics. The data sets are then classified by an iterative algorithm based on a complex Wishart density function of the 6/spl times/6 matrix. A class number reduction technique is then applied on the 64 resulting clusters to improve the efficiency of the interpretation and representation of each class. An alternative technique is also proposed which introduces the polarimetric cross-correlation information to refine the results of classification to a small number of clusters using the conditional probability of the cross-correlation matrix. These classification schemes are applied to full polarimetric P, L, and C-band SAR images of the Nezer Forest, France, acquired by the NASA/JPL AIRSAR sensor in 1989.},

Unlike beamforming, which presumes a high correlation between signals either transmitted or received by an array, the MIMO concept exploits the independence between signals at the array elements. In conventional radar, target scintillations are regarded as a nuisance parameter that degrades radar performance. The novelty of MIMO radar is that it takes the opposite view; namely, it capitalizes on target scintillations to improve the radar's performance. We introduce the MIMO concept for radar. The MIMO radar system under consideration consists of a transmit array with widely-spaced elements such that each views a different aspect of the target. The array at the receiver is a conventional array used for direction finding (DF). The system performance analysis is carried out in terms of the Cramer-Rao bound of the mean-square error in estimating the target direction. It is shown that MIMO radar leads to significant performance improvement in DF accuracy.},

  abstract = {Inspired by recent advances in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, this proposal introduces the statistical MIMO radar concept. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the statistical MIMO is being proposed for radar. The fundamental difference between statistical MIMO and other radar array systems is that the latter seek to maximize the coherent processing gain, while statistical MIMO radar capitalizes on the diversity of target scattering to improve radar performance. Coherent processing is made possible by highly correlated signals at the receiver array, whereas in statistical MIMO radar, the signals received by the array elements are uncorrelated. Radar targets generally consist of many small elemental scatterers that are fused by the radar waveform and the processing at the receiver, to result in echoes with fluctuating amplitude and phase. It is well known that in conventional radar, slow fluctuations of the target radar cross section (RCS) result in target fades that degrade radar performance. By spacing the antenna elements at the transmitter and at the receiver such that the target angular spread is manifested, the MIMO radar can exploit the spatial diversity of target scatterers opening the way to a variety of new techniques that can improve radar performance. This paper focuses on the application of the target spatial diversity to improve detection performance. The optimal detector in the Neyman–Pearson sense is developed and analyzed for the statistical MIMO radar. It is shown that the optimal detector consists of noncoherent processing of the receiver sensors' outputs and that for cases of practical interest, detection performance is superior to that obtained through coherent processing. An optimal detector invariant to the signal and noise levels is also developed and analyzed. In this case as well, statistical MIMO radar provides great improvements over other types of array radars.},

Here we propose the use of multiple signals with arbitrary cross-correlation matrix R, and show that R can be chosen to achieve or approximate a desired spatial transmit beampattern. Two specific problems are addressed. The first is the constrained optimization problem of finding the value of R which causes the true transmit beampattern to be close in some sense to a desired beampattern. This is approached using convex optimization techniques. The second is the problem of designing multiple constant-modulus waveforms with given cross-correlation R. The use of coded binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) waveforms is considered. A method for finding the code sequences based on random signaling with a structured correlation matrix is proposed. It is also shown that by restricting the class of admissible waveforms one reduces the set of possible signal correlation matrices.},

  abstract = {A new dual-polarized slot-coupled microstrip patch antenna is presented, which can achieve high-isolation, low cross-polarization levels, a wide bandwidth, and low backward radiation levels. The coupling slot is an H-shaped slot. For wide bandwidth and easy integration with active circuits, it uses slot-coupled stacked microstrip patches. The theoretical analysis is based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. First, a parametric study on the input impedance of the antenna with a single input port is presented. Based on the results, a dual-polarized microstrip antenna is designed, fabricated, and then measured. The measured return loss exhibits an impedance bandwidth of over 20.9\% and the isolation between two polarization ports is better than 36 dB over the bandwidth. The cross-polarization levels in both E and H planes are better than 22 dB. The front-to-back ratio of the antenna radiation pattern is better than 21 dB. Both theoretical and experimental results of return loss, isolation, and radiation patterns are presented and discussed.},

Polarimetric design of the transmit waveforms based on the properties of the target scattering matrix provides better performance than transmitting waveforms with only fixed horizontal or vertical polarizations. We propose a radar system that combines the advantages of both systems by transmitting polarized waveforms from multiple distributed antennas, in order to detect a point-like stationary target. The proposed system employs 2-D vector sensors at the receivers, each of which measures the horizontal and vertical components of the received electric field separately. We design the Neyman-Pearson detector for such systems. We derive approximate expressions for the probability of false alarm (PFA) and the probability of detection (PD). Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that optimal design of the antenna polarizations provides improved performance over MIMO systems that transmit waveforms of fixed polarizations over all the antennas. We also demonstrate that having multiple widely separated antennas gives improved performance over single-input-single-output (SISO) polarimetric radar. We also demonstrate that processing the vector measurements at each receiver separately gives improved performance over systems that linearly combine both the received signals to give scalar measurements.},

  abstract = {Imaging radar is a key perception technology for automotive and industrial applications. A lot of progress has been made with high channel count systems, deploying, for example, 12 transmit and 16 receive channels with cascaded monolithic microwave integrated circuit solutions. Nevertheless, fully automated driving requires even higher angular resolution for drive-under/drive-over decisions and exact predictions of object trajectories in dense urban driving scenarios. Both problems can be solved by increasing the antenna size and building larger radars. However, there is a physical limit to what can be placed on the front of a car, and manufacturing very large arrays is quite difficult. Thus, coherent automotive radar networks are a way to achieve high spatial resolution and obtain the complete velocity vector of an object from a single measurement. This solution is commercially attractive, as the sensor can remain relatively small, and complexity can be moved from the physical hardware to algorithms and processing. Two different test setups, each comprised of two multiple-input multiple-output radar units in the 76-77 GHz band, are presented in this article. To obtain azimuth and additional elevation information, the setups use a 1D and a 2D antenna array, respectively. Processing-based coherent evaluation is employed to create an additional radar image with doubled azimuth resolution and improved signal-to-noise ratio and to enable the estimation of vectorial target velocities. These benefits are presented and compared with optical reference images in traffic scenarios.},

Secondly, a hybrid feed mechanism with a coplanar waveguide (CPW) feed and a slot feed is used to achieve a dual-polarized DR antenna. A vertical strip is added at the center strip of the CPW feed to improve the coupling to the DR antenna. Also, input isolation exceeding 35 dB has been obtained in the band. Good cross-polarization levels less than -20 dB in the broadside direction are attained. The measured far-field radiation patterns are stable in the passband and the measured gains are around 5.5 dBi for the two feed ports of both cases.},

The most commonly used extended object tracking methods are briefly introduced. In addition, measurement profiles of road users, car, cyclists, and pedestrians are investigated to compare each model and its assumptions with the real data. The obtained information can be further used to define the appropriate object specific and sensor specific measurement model. The measurement distribution is discussed in detail and compared with the models' assumptions. Extended object tracking is performed on the obtained data and performance analysis is carried out using high resolution ground truth. The evaluation is carried out separately on the radar and lidar data on exemplary traffic scenes. As a final step, a track-to-track intersection fusion approach is evaluated on the same data set to find out the different information gains. The relation between measurements and track behavior as well as other influences are discussed.},

The new technique enjoys the advantages of the MIMO radar without sacrificing the main advantage of the phased-array radar which is the coherent processing gain at the transmitting side. The essence of the proposed technique is to partition the transmit array into a number of subarrays that are allowed to overlap. Then, each subarray is used to coherently transmit a waveform which is orthogonal to the waveforms transmitted by other subarrays. Coherent processing gain can be achieved by designing a weight vector for each subarray to form a beam towards a certain direction in space. Moreover, the subarrays are combined jointly to form a MIMO radar resulting in higher angular resolution capabilities. Substantial improvements offered by the proposed phased-MIMO radar technique as compared to the phased-array and MIMO radar techniques are demonstrated analytically and by simulations through analyzing the corresponding beam patterns and the achievable output signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratios. Both analytical and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed phased-MIMO radar.},

Parametric study for both antennas is presented to demonstrate the performance at millimeter wave frequency for wireless communication network (5G application). Roger RT5880 substrates with permittivity 2.2 and loss tangent 0.0009 are used to implement the antennas with two thicknesses of 0.508 mm and 0.127 mm respectively. Both antennas have the same size of substrate 12x12 mm with a full ground plane was used. Structures designs have been done by using computer simulation technology (CST).

Challenging automotive-related gestures need different techniques for accurate and quick classification. In this paper, classifications based on temporal radar data using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), and BRNNs (Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks) are going to be introduced and compared. RNNs have the advantage of getting the classification decision even before the arrival of the total data stream. Twelve challenging scenarios are presented, together with the signal processing chain. Classification is performed on successive range-velocity diagrams, which spares the step of time-frequency processing already used in other applications. Four different models are introduced which result in high classification accuracies. This shows a high potential of employing radar for gesture classification using temporal information.},

  abstract = {High angular resolution provides improved environmental perception and increases the detection quality of extended targets. It is therefore a key requirement towards future radar systems for autonomous driving. The angular resolution of a radar system fundamentally depends on its antenna array aperture size. It is technically difficult and economically challenging to realize a large aperture radar system as a single sensor. Radar networks, consisting of multiple individual radar sensors, mitigate the challenges caused by creating a large aperture radar system. This paper presents a radar network consisting of two individual MIMO radar sensors equipped with L-shaped physical antenna arrays. L-shaped arrays for the individual sensors are chosen to achieve a rectangular equally spaced radar network vir-tual aperture. Furthermore, the paper discusses the performance of the resulting virtual aperture in the context of DoA estimation. Measurements of a bicycle, conducted with a coherently coupled radar network consisting of 768 virtual channels, demonstrate the performance of a high angular resolution radar system.},

  abstract = {A key aspect of the imaging capability of radar systems is the angular resolution, which is determined by the aperture size of the antenna array. Therefore technologies such as MIMO and especially radar networks consisting of multiple independent MIMO radar sensors seek to maximize the virtual aperture size. Depending on the range and velocity resolution of the MIMO radar network, multistatic aspects must be accounted for. So far, those multistatic effects were seen as errors, which must be compensated for in order to restore the classical DoA properties of the virtual aperture, described by the narrowband beam pattern. This paper shows that new virtual aperture designs with larger antenna spacings are possible while still preserving the angular ambiguity range of smaller antenna spacings, as long as the multistatic effects of distributed radar networks, namely radar networks whose virtual aperture is large in comparison to the range resolution, are correctly accounted for. The larger antenna element spacing enables larger aperture sizes leading to higher angular resolution. This paper illustrates that the well-known, Fourier Tranformation-based signal processing is unable to exploit this potential of distributed radar networks, and an computationally efficient approximated matched filter is proposed. This article presents a signal model for distributed radar networks, suitable signal processing, and a comparison to the well-known Fourier Transformation-based signal processing for compact radar networks. Both the signal model and the proposed signal processing are verified by measurements with a radar sensor network composed of 2 MIMO radar sensors operating in the automotive frequency range of 76 \textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmG\textbackslash mathrmHz\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmto\textbackslash, 81 \textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmG\textbackslash mathrmHz providing 64 virtual channels with a range resolution of 0.03 \textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmm.

  abstract = {A stacked multi-layer substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) microstrip patch antenna with broadband operating bandwidth and low cross-polarization radiation is provided. A complete study on the propagating element bandwidth and cross polarization level is presented to demonstrate the importance of the design. The proposed antenna includes three stacked printed circuit board (PCB) layers, including one layer for the radiating 2 × 2 rectangular patch elements and two SIW PCB layers for the feeding network. There are two common methods for excitation in cavity-backed patch antennas: probe feeding (PF) and aperture coupling (AC). PF can be used to increase the bandwidth of the antenna. Although this method increases the antenna’s bandwidth, it produces a strong cross-polarized field. The AC method can be used to suppress cross-polarized fields in microstrip patch antennas. As microstrip patch antennas are inherently narrowband, the AC method has little effect on their bandwidth. This paper proposes an antenna that is simultaneously fed by AC and PF. As a result of this innovation, the operating bandwidth of the antenna has increased, and cross-polarization has been reduced. Actually, the combination of probe feeding and aperture coupling schemes leads to achieving a broadband operating bandwidth. The arrangement of radiator elements and cavities implements a mirrored excitation technique while maintaining a low cross-polarization level. In both numerical and experimental solutions, a less than −30 dB cross-polarization level has been achieved for all of the main directions. A fractional impedance bandwidth of 29.8\% (10.55–14.25 GHz) for S11 {$<$} −10-dB is measured for the proposed array. Simulated and measured results illustrate good agreement. Having features like low cost, light weight, compactness, broadband, integration capabilities, and low cross-polarization level makes the designed antenna suitable for remote-sensing and satellite applications.},

  abstract = {Sensing explicit communication signals like gestures provides autonomous vehicles (AVs) expressive information about pedestrians’ intentions. In automotive applications, gesture recognition algorithms have to provide high recognition accuracy under ego-motion, and at larger distances. In principle, radar-based methods add both accuracy and reliability to a vehicle’s gesture perception. However, while ego-motion has little impact on algorithms working with camera data, it significantly alters the radar responses of the pedestrians, e.g. due to the non-static appearance of clutter. To meet the resulting challenges, this paper proposes a radar-based gesture recognition algorithm for radar sensors in vehicles. By optimizing the signal processing chain to extract clutter-reduced radar observations of the pedestrians, the impact of the environment and the ego-motion on the recognition accuracy is minimized. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained for gesture classification. The algorithm is tested on a comprehensive gesture dataset recorded with an experimental vehicle in two different outdoor scenarios. The CNN achieves an average recognition accuracy under ego-motion of 91\% for distances up to 15 m. In addition, it is shown that appropriate data augmentation strategies allow the classifier to be successfully trained on data from static measurements, with an accuracy of 85.9\% at significantly less measurement cost and effort.},

Measured results show a −10 dB impedance bandwidth of 77.92-79.15 GHz (1.6\%), a peak gain of 18.2 dBi, and a SLL of −19.1 dB in H-plane. The cross-polarization level is reduced to nearly 30 dB lower than the co-polarization level. Antenna II is a 77-GHz staggered series-fed six-element TM05-mode patch array designed for compact integration. An in-phase excitation scheme with an array spacing of 3łambda \textsubscript{g} /2 is proposed. This antenna achieves a measured bandwidth of 73.76–78.44 GHz (6.1\%) and a high gain of 17.5 dBi with only six elements. Antenna III further introduces parasitic strips alongside each patch from Antenna II to generate additional resonances and to enhance bandwidth. Measured results exhibit a bandwidth of 72.64–80.75 GHz (10.57\%) and a peak gain of 17.8 dBi, representing an increase of 4.47\% in bandwidth compared to Antenna II. In summary, Antenna I achieves high gain, low SLL, and low cross-polarization with higher complexity, while Antennas II/III simplify design yet deliver high gain and wide bandwidth, offering promising solutions for automotive radars.},

The proposed antenna has the advantages of low profile, low cost, and ease of fabrication for the millimeter-wave band. By adjusting the gaps between the radiating strips and feeding line, an antenna with low sidelobe level can easily be designed.

Written by two of the most recognized leaders in this field, Polarimetric Radar Imaging: From Basics to Applications presents polarimetric radar imaging and processing techniques and shows how to develop remote sensing applications using PolSAR imaging radar. The book provides a substantial and balanced introduction to the basic theory and advanced concepts of polarimetric scattering mechanisms, speckle statistics and speckle filtering, polarimetric information analysis and extraction techniques, and applications typical to radar polarimetric remote sensing. It explains the importance of wave polarization theory and the speckle phenomenon in the information retrieval problem of microwave imaging and inverse scattering. The authors demonstrate how to devise intelligent information extraction algorithms for remote sensing applications. They also describe more advanced polarimetric analysis techniques for polarimetric target decompositions, polarization orientation effects, polarimetric scattering modeling, speckle filtering, terrain and forest classification, manmade target analysis, and PolSAR interferometry.With sample PolSAR data sets and software available for download, this self-contained, hands-on book encourages you to analyze space-borne and airborne PolSAR and polarimetric interferometric SAR (Pol-InSAR) data and then develop applications using this data.},

  abstract = {In this communication, a novel approach for high-order modes excitation using substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) is proposed for the implementation of a dual-polarization cavity-backed slot antenna. The antenna consists of a resonant SIW cavity with eight radiating slots and two separated SIW feeding networks. The vertically linear polarization (VLP) and horizontally linear polarization (HLP) are realized by adopting the TE430 and TE340 modes with different signal schemes. The field distributions and the surface currents of the TE430 and TE340 modes are used to analyze and illuminate the radiation mechanism. To further validate the proposed design, a 2 × 2 polarization-diverse SIW cavity-backed antenna array is fabricated and tested. The measured results show that the impedance bandwidths (S11 {$<$}; -10 dB) for the two linear-polarization (LP) states are 10.73-10.9 GHz and 10.75-10.83 GHz, respectively, while the 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth for the right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) is 10.75-10.83 GHz. The measured peak gains of the two LP modes and CP mode are 13.4, 12.92, and 12.2 dBi, respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates an effective way of high-order modes (TE430 and TE340 modes) generation in a single SIW cavity, which has significant meaning in polarization-diversity applications.},

In this paper, a weighted combination polarization filter is proposed, which retains the original target signal while suppressing the interference within one step.

Grating lobes in the two-way radiation pattern are avoided by using different element spacings on transmission and reception. The transmit and receive aperture functions are selected such that the convolution of the aperture functions produces a desired effective aperture. A desired effective aperture is simply an aperture with an appropriate width, element spacing, and shape such that the Fourier transform of this function gives the desired two-way radiation pattern. If a synthetic aperture approach is used, an exact solution to the problem is possible. However, for conventional imaging, often only an approximation of the desired effective aperture can be found. Different strategies for obtaining these approximate solutions are described. The radiation pattern of a sparse array designed using the effective aperture concept is compared experimentally with the radiation patterns of a dense array, and sparse arrays with periodic and random element spacing. We show that the number of elements in a 128-element linear array can be reduced by at least four times with little degradation of the beam forming properties of the array.},

Being an inexpensive, all-weather and long-range sensor that simultaneously provides velocity measurements, radar is expected to be indispensable to the future of autonomous driving. Traditional radar signal processing techniques often cannot distinguish reflections from objects of interest from clutter and are generally limited to detecting peaks in the received signal. These peak detection methods effectively collapse the image-like radar signal into a sparse point cloud. In this paper, we demonstrate a deep-learning-based vehicle detection solution which operates on the image-like tensor instead of the point cloud resulted by peak detection.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to implement such a system.},

To avoid this, a null phase-shift polarization (NPSP) filter is proposed, which is composed of a linear polarization transformer (LPVT), a conventional single-notch polarization (SNP) filter and an amplitude/phase compensation device (A/PCD). The interference, which has polarization different from those of the desired target signal, can be suppressed completely while the target signal remains without distortion. Some applications of high-frequency (HF) radars for suppressing the radio interference are introduced. Simulation results from the experimentally derived data indicate that the improvement of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can be expected to be more than 28 dB. The proposed NPSP filter is effective in HF radar or other coherent systems.},

A crucial part of the hardware is the antenna which is connected by lines to the radar chip. These components are usually built on printed circuit boards (PCBs) that have to fulfill high automotive requests under all environmental conditions. As a consequence, material properties are a critical factor for the functionality and reliability of systems, like-wise new materials are available in the market. Fourteen interesting materials of different classes [polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), polyphenyl ether (PPE), epoxy-based resin, and liquid crystal polymer (LCP)] were evaluated in this work at their initial state, while heating to 125 °C and after storage with 85\% relative humidity (RH) at 85 °C. It is shown that there are new candidates for millimeter wave applications beyond the PTFE materials. Nevertheless, it is necessary to test each material individually for its properties and optimize the parameters in simulation because they differ from the values in the datasheet. In addition, the properties depend on the used line setup, in this work microstrip lines. For the measurements, multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration and ring resonators were used and give a good overview by loss and effective permittivity depending on the environmental condition.},

The choice and design of the respective sensor antennas are determined by the requirement for high gain and low loss combined with small size and depth for vehicle integration, the challenges by the millimeter-wave frequency range, and a great cost pressure for this commercial application. Consequently, planar antennas are dominating in the lower frequency range, while lens and reflector antennas had been the first choice at 76.5 GHz, partly in folded configurations. With increasing requirements towards a much more detailed observation of the scenery in front or around the vehicle, multibeam antennas or scanning antennas have been designed, and solutions based on (digital) beamforming with a number of integrated antennas are in use or under development. General antenna concepts, partly including some system aspects, as well as three realized antenna configurations will be described in detail in this contribution.},

A synthetic aperture technique is employed to address the angular resolution concerns commonly associated with radars at lower frequencies.

  abstract = {In this article, a new wideband cavity-backed bow-tie microstrip antenna is presented for short-range 77-81 GHz radar applications. The design is based on a subarray consisting of two single elements. Each element consists of a multilayer bow-tie patch antenna surrounded by a metallic cavity to suppress the surface waves and parallel plate modes. The subarray elements are fed through a laminated waveguide with 180° phase shift. An eight-layer build-up and a new advanced multilayer PCB technology, the so-called any-layer PCB technology, is used for the fabrication. The performance of this antenna has been verified by both simulations and measurements. A bandwidth of more than 8\% is achieved. The gain is 7.9 dBi, and the radiation efficiency is 70\% at 79 GHz. Beam widths of 84° in the E-plane and 48° in the H-plane are obtained, which are compatible with radar requirements for short-range applications.},

  abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive technique for calibrating wideband frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) fully polarimetric radars employing linear FM (LFM) signal chirps. A detailed system distortion model is developed that accounts for both polarimetric distortions and distortions caused by nonlinearities in the transmitted and received radar chirps over multiple polarization channels. Using the radar responses of two point targets at known distances from the radar, the calibration technique is able to estimate the range-dependent nonlinearities in phase and correct them for all targets at all ranges. This allows the radar to achieve its ideal range resolution. In addition, the calibration technique corrects for channel imbalances in the polarimetric radar using a metallic sphere of known diameter and any depolarizing target. Both numeric simulations and actual polarimetric radar measurements using a wideband FMCW radar operating over 76.5–82 GHz were used to validate the calibration technique.},

However, the physical visualization, bases, and their interrelationships are frequently from disparate sources. The increasing use of multi-function phased arrays highlights other topics of concern, since the changing directions of steered beams results in dynamic changes in polarization that must be dealt with. Following basic visualization in terms of circular basis components, the circular-to-linear basis-transform matrices are derived. Since similarities or interactions among different polarizations are concerned, the physical and analytic utility of the Poincaré sphere is reviewed. Geometric effects inherently basic to all phased array problems are demonstrated and analyzed in connection with polarization control. Cross-polarization interpretation and association with pattern measurements are described.},

The method provides class information both on the radar target- and object-level. Radar targets are classified individually after extending the target features with a cropped block of the 3D radar cube around their positions, thereby capturing the motion of moving parts in the local velocity distribution. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed for this classification step. Afterwards, object proposals are generated with a clustering step, which not only considers the radar targets’ positions and velocities, but their calculated class scores as well. In experiments on a real-life dataset we demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both target- and object-wise by reaching an average of 0.70 (baseline: 0.68) target-wise and 0.56 (baseline: 0.48) object-wise F1 score. Furthermore, we examine the importance of the used features in an ablation study.},

The antenna is composed of 512 (16 × 32) 2 × 2-slot subarrays arranged with equal spacing and excited by a nonuniform corporate-feed-network. A two dimensional amplitude-tapering (complying with Taylor distribution) is used to achieve the low sidelobe levels (SLLs).

A prototype slotted waveguide array is fabricated to verify the array properties. Measurements show that the matching of the array is better than -14 dB over the entire bandwidth. The first SLL is lower than -18.9 dB/-24 dB with the maximum 3-dB beamwidth of 2.3°/1.3° in the E-/H-plane, respectively.

The proposed design employs a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration with single-CP TX antennas and dual-CP RX antennas, enabling the acquisition of sufficient polarimetric information while reducing the number of transmitters (TXs) by half. Gapwaveguide technology is utilized for the implementation of the multilayer waveguide front-end. Series-fed septum polarizers are employed for the antenna design with low-profile characteristics. Measurement results indicate that the antenna elements enable a high level of cross-polarization across the field of view (FoV). Integration of the waveguide front-end with RF boards is achieved using gap waveguide packaging techniques. Static measurements were conducted on common scattering objects to evaluate the sensor’s performance. Polarimetric rotation signatures of the objects were acquired from the measurements, demonstrating the sensor’s potential for use in object identification tasks. Dynamic measurements were performed to evaluate the sensor’s Doppler response. The assessments indicate a high level of accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed sensor in analyzing dynamic movements. Overall, the proposed polarimetric radar sensor provides persuasive evidence that gap waveguide technology is a highly promising candidate for the realization of advanced automotive radar front-ends.},

  abstract = {A 77 GHz gapwaveguide radar antenna system with launcher-in-package (LiP) technology is presented in this paper for automotive imaging applications. Firstly, state-of-the-art LiP technology integrated with radar transceivers is proposed. The transceivers are equipped with waveguide interfaces for RF connection, enabling direct integration with waveguide antennas. Robust interconnects for coupling transceivers to waveguide antennas with non-galvanic contacts are proposed using gapwaveguide packaging technology. A simultaneous multi-mode imaging radar system using 4 cascaded aforementioned transceivers is introduced. Designated antenna elements of the system are realized by slot arrays with center-fed ridge gapwaveguides. Ultimately, the imaging radar antenna has a top radiating slot layer, a middle distribution layer and a bottom interconnect layer capable of accommodating 4 LiP radar transceivers with considerable assembly tolerance which is really one of the key aspects for commercial automotive radar applications. Input matching and radiation patterns of the antenna are verified by measurement. The results indicate that the proposed gapwaveguide imaging radar antenna in conjunction with the novel LiP packaging is able to serve the radar system properly. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the proposed gapwaveguide antenna system is the first imaging radar antenna system ever developed for LiP components. This work provides a compact, high-efficiency and cost-effective solution for the integration of complex radar systems with waveguide antennas.},

An extensive set of quality assurance and quality control procedures were developed and applied to all collected data. Engineering measurements yielded calibration characteristics for the antenna, reflector, and radome, which were applied during flight, to produce the radar moments in real-time. Temperature changes in the instrument during flight affect the receiver gains, leading to some bias. Post project, we estimate the temperature-induced gain errors and apply gain corrections to improve the quality of the data. The reflectivity calibration is monitored by comparing sea surface cross-section measurements against theoretically calculated model values. These comparisons indicate that the HCR is calibrated to within 1–2 dB of the theory. A radar echo classification algorithm was developed to identify “cloud echo” and distinguish it from artifacts. Model reanalysis data and digital terrain elevation data were interpolated to the time-range grid of the radar data, to provide an environmental reference.},

The considered sensor comprises two subarrays of elements with orthogonal polarizations, which collect data in the presence of multiple narrow-band Radio Frequency (RF) signals emitted from unknown angular directions. The proposed algorithms, fast-converging and hyperparameter free, leverage the inherent sparsity of the signal model (across multiple snapshots) to estimate the DOAs. Numerical analysis shows the effectiveness of POL-SLIM and POL-SPICE to accurately estimate the DOA of the sources, in particular with a small number of collected snapshots. Moreover, they attain the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) at a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) value lower than the single-polarization counterparts.},

The book comprehensively reviews massive MIMO systems, key technologies, challenges, and future directions. The book presents green RF technologies and systems for MIMO antenna systems. Moreover, the book presents innovation in massive MIMO cellular networks and antennas. The family of LML detectors and the family of LAS detectors for massive MIMO communications are presented in the book. Active shielding methods for space radiation protection are also presented in the book. This book evaluates massive MIMO performance with Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami fading channels and compares half-duplex and full-duplex modes using the HMR protocol. MIMO antenna arrays and sparse polarimetric arrays for MIMO systems are discussed in the book. In MIMO antenna networks, multiple antennas are used to transmit and receive elements. The antenna's electromagnetic signals are combined at each port of the RF communication system to improve the communication system specifications and improve the system's electrical performance by enabling data to be processed in real-time over many signal RF channels. MIMO systems provide better signal strength even without a clear line of sight as they utilize the bounced and reflected RF transmissions. MIMO systems provide better quality and quantity of video information sent over the network. Multiple data links minimize the number of lost data packets, which results in better video and audio quality. The book may be a valuable resource for MIMO antenna designers, academy researchers, communication engineers, and communication systems project managers involved in developing and manufacturing MIMO arrays and communication systems.

This technique assumes perfect isolation between antenna ports. It is shown that all magnitudes and phases (relative to one of the like-polarized linear polarization configurations) of the radar transfer function can be calibrated without knowledge of the scattering matrix of the second target. Comparison of the values measured (using this calibration technique) for a tilted cylinder in the X-band with theoretical values shows agreement within +or-0.3 dB in magnitude and +or-5 degrees in phase. The radar overall cross-polarization isolation was 25 dB. The technique is particularly useful for calibrating a radar under field conditions, because it does not require the careful alignment of calibration targets.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Automotive radar perception is an integral part of automated driving systems. Radar sensors benefit from their excellent robustness against adverse weather conditions such as snow, fog, or heavy rain. Despite the fact that machine-learning-based object detection is traditionally a camera-based domain, vast progress has been made for lidar sensors, and radar is also catching up. Recently, several new techniques for using machine learning algorithms towards the correct detection and classification of moving road users in automotive radar data have been introduced. However, most of them have not been compared to other methods or require next generation radar sensors which are far more advanced than current conventional automotive sensors. This article makes a thorough comparison of existing and novel radar object detection algorithms with some of the most successful candidates from the image and lidar domain. All experiments are conducted using a conventional automotive radar system. In addition to introducing all architectures, special attention is paid to the necessary point cloud preprocessing for all methods. By assessing all methods on a large and open real world data set, this evaluation provides the first representative algorithm comparison in this domain and outlines future research directions.},

The resolution of conventional automotive radar sensors results in a sparse data representation which is tough to recover by subsequent signal processing. In this article, classifier ensembles originating from a one-vs-one binarization paradigm are enriched by one-vs-all correction classifiers. They are utilized to efficiently classify individual traffic participants and also identify hidden object classes which have not been presented to the classifiers during training. For each classifier of the ensemble an individual feature set is determined from a total set of 98 features. Thereby, the overall classification performance can be improved when compared to previous methods and, additionally, novel classes can be identified much more accurately. Furthermore, the proposed structure allows to give new insights in the importance of features for the recognition of individual classes which is crucial for the development of new algorithms and sensor requirements.},

  abstract = {Separability, detection capability, and height estimation performance are key measures of high performance 4D imaging radars. While many different sensors have been presented in recent years, no sensor-independent comparison of the performance achievable with differing array realizations was given. Therefore, in this work in total 113 sub-arrays of one large uniform rectangular array are analyzed. Measurements of real-world scenarios are performed with a high-resolution 4D imaging radar system with 1728 virtual channels on the static edge case to assess the performance in the angular domain. Regarding the above-mentioned performance criteria, three main conclusions can be derived from the performed analysis: Although the angular resolution depends on the array size, the separation capability of objects with small radar cross section from stronger ones depends on the channel count and not the aperture size. In scenarios with many targets located in the mid-range of the sensor, the detection capability increases at a constant channel count for smaller arrays with a lower sparsity in contrast to larger ones with less channels. Hereby, increasing the fill factor while keeping the aperture size constant is more beneficial to the performance than increasing the aperture size while keeping the fill factor constant.},

The antenna occupies relatively small volume (30 × 30 × 6.7 mm3), hence offers more space for ease of integration with other components. The antenna achieves dual polarization by utilizing two symmetric coupling apertures that excite two orthogonal modes. The dual feed portions are placed on a Rogers R04360 substrate, while the square patches are deposited onto Rogers RT-5880 substrate layers. The antenna is designed to operate in the frequency range of 6–8 GHz. The realized antenna at the center frequency of 7 GHz achieves a dual-polarized broadside radiation pattern having a high gain of 7.57 and 7.69 dBi at port-1 and port-2, respectively. It also achieves fractional bandwidths of 24 and 32\% at port-1 and port-2 while maintaining high port isolation of more than 25 dB.

  abstract = {Polarimetric radars require multiple channels to transmit and receive orthogonal polarized electromagnetic waves for further characterization of targets compared to single polarized radars. A reliable characterization of targets is important for modern advanced driving assistant systems to analyze complex scenarios for highly automated vehicles. However, radar systems for automotive applications require to be robust, cost-effective and easy to integrate while polarimetric radars have increased hardware need with higher costs and failure rates. To overcome this, a single polarized radar sensor can be placed in front of a frequency selective surface, which allows a frequency-dependent polarization rotation. Thus, different polarized electromagnetic waves containing characteristic changes by the target can be converted to a single polarized electromagnetic wave. The designed surface reflects linear polarized electromagnetic waves and rotates their polarization by 0° or 90° in dependency of frequency. In this paper a frequency selective surface for frequencies between 77 and 81 GHz is presented. These frequencies support automotive short range radar applications making the reflector attractive for evaluation of target characterization in vehicles. The structure is designed for a 45° oblique incidence and is the result of scaling a reflector concept designed in previous research projects for lower frequencies. Its theory is applied to the design, a simulation model is constructed and manufacturing tolerances are analyzed. A measurement setup is established for evaluation of a prototype. The measurement results verify the concept and further improvements of the reflector for automotive applications are discussed.},

By combing the coaxial-line feed magneto-electric (ME) dipoles with the aperture coupled dielectric cavity, a hybrid-feed 2 × 2-unit ME-dipole sub-array is invented. The low-loss ridge gap waveguide (RGWG) corporate-feed network is used to replace the high-loss substrate-based feed networks and high-cost RWG feed networks.

  abstract = {Two approaches for differentially fed, polarimetric antennas with a center frequency of 77.5 GHz are introduced. These are an aperture-coupled patch (ACP) antenna and a monopole antenna with two differentially fed monopole pairs. Easy planar integration with differential MMICs is given through the differential stripline feed. Both antennas are designed for high bandwidth from 70 to 85 GHz for 10 dB return loss and high polarization purity. A stacked conical horn included in both designs results in a high gain of 8.5 dBi and a radiation pattern with one symmetric main beam without significant side lobes, reducing coupling to other elements in a future antenna array. After an introduction, design goals for the antennas are presented. Then, the design procedures for the two concepts are described together with simulation results. For measurement of the antennas, a feed network has been developed and the monopole antenna has been chosen for realization. The paper will be concluded by measurement results that are in good agreement with the simulations.},

The perspective of a more accurate comprehension of the surrounding environment through the use of orthogonal polarizations has now become very attractive, given the rising number of antennas available to automotive radar technology. This article aims to present a fully polarimetric automotive radar front end. The requirements of a polarimetric automotive radar are investigated and the design of a 12 \textbackslash times 16 antenna system, working in the band 76–81 GHz, and fulfilling them is presented. The system calibration was carried out using a dihedral corner reflector. Its characteristics were analyzed in detail and exploited to reach an optimal alignment with the radar, thus allowing the polarimetric calibration through the measurement of only one target and one scattering matrix. The validity of the system and the potential impact of polarimetry on automotive radar applications are verified and presented through several real-radar measurements, both in a controlled environment in the anechoic chamber and outdoors. Different applications are investigated, such as multipath detection and target classification, by applying the Pauli decomposition to the polarimetric data.},

  abstract = {The issue of antenna cross-polarization isolation has been previously discussed for the design of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (SARs). Dual-polarized antennas with cross-polarization isolation that is better than -30 dB are desirable for more convenient polarimetric data calibration since measurements of antenna crosstalk (magnitude and phase) variations with incidence angle are not required. For an antenna with significant polarization crosstalk, it is still possible to retrieve pure polarization measurements of HH, HV, VH, and VV provided that the four corresponding received voltages are measured. However, it is not possible to recover from cross-polarization contamination for single- or dual-polarization measurements. Therefore, it is important to set up a minimum requirement on dual-polarized antenna isolation so that single- and dual-polarization applications are not unduly affected. In this letter, the minimum requirement on cross-polarization antenna isolation is investigated for operational use of C-band SARs in maritime surveillance applications. Calibrated polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data are used to simulate single- and dual-polarization data with cross-polarization contamination for a dual-polarized antenna with cross-polarization isolation ranging from -20 to -35 dB. It is shown that the cross-polarization HV (or VH) channel can be significantly affected, particularly at steep incidence angles. As a result, key applications that require the use of pure HV, such as ship detection and wind-speed measurements, are significantly affected. A requirement for a minimum of -30-dB antenna isolation is established. Antennas with cross-polarization isolation better than -35 dB are desirable for reliable exploitation of HV data at steep incidence angles.},

In a one-dimensional large-scale MIMO array, the conventional approach of using multiple patches and decoupling networks significantly increases the antenna size. To address this, this paper utilizes compact self-decoupled patches, enabling extremely small element spacing while maintaining high isolation levels. Accordingly, a compact size feature can be obtained. Then, gain and bandwidth enhancements are realized with a combination of multiple patches and T-junction dividers. The feasibility of the proposed concept is validated by measurement on a two-element MIMO antenna. The measured results demonstrate that the proposed antennas have good operation characteristics at 4.8 GHz with a small element spacing of 0.008λ. The measured operating bandwidth is about 5\%, with isolation of better than 19 dB. A maximum broadside gain of 7.2 dBi can also be yielded.},

It enables one to measure different scattering matrices with only one reflector. One alignment must be performed and the scattering matrices are measured at the same range.

  abstract = {Spectral polarimetry is based on combined simultaneous Doppler and polarization measurements, with a close look on the polarization dependence of the radar signal per velocity bin of the Doppler spectrum. The principle of radar spectral polarimetry and the main steps of the related processing are given in the paper. The processing results in clutter- and noise-free atmospheric spectrographs (Doppler spectra for every height). When the processed spectrographs are integrated to calculate the classical Doppler moments, the resulting estimates of reflectivity, mean Doppler velocity, Doppler width and polarimetric parameters are improved. Improved profiles have the potentiality to lead to better estimates of rain rates, liquid water and ice water content, and wind. In the paper, illustration is provided in the context of wind profiling, which employs as input mean Doppler velocity profiles. Another application consists of linking the processed Doppler spectrum with the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) of the medium being probed. Thus, in addition to the more traditional method of expressing the Doppler spectrum in its statistical moments, spectral polarimetry can also provide detailed microphysical information of precipitation and clouds in the case of slant profiling. One illustration is shown in the case of mixed-phase clouds. Both illustrations are part of the extended data set collected by the S-band radar TARA (Transportable Atmospheric RAdar) within the COPS campaign (Convective Orographycally-induced Precipitation Study) in the black forest in Germany during the summer of 2007.},

This procedure largely improves profiles of moments and polarimetric parameters of atmospheric targets. Several spectral polarimetric clutter-reduction techniques, which are based on thresholding and intended for real-time processing, are discussed in this paper. A new method, the double spectral linear depolarization ratio clutter-suppression technique, is proposed. Very satisfactory performances are obtained with this method, which can be used in the full range of elevations (0°–90°). Spectral polarimetric clutter-suppression techniques for real-time processing were studied for the S-band high-resolution Transportable Atmospheric Radar (TARA) profiler. For this study, precipitation, cloud, and clear-air scattering are considered examples of atmospheric echoes. After successful testing in 2008, the double spectral linear depolarization ratio filter was implemented in the real-time processing of the X-band scanning drizzle radar (IDRA).},

The array is composed of two identical subarrays formed by cascading an equal number of four-port aperture-coupled cross-patch elements and terminated on a two-port radiating matched load. By properly exciting the array, dual linear or circular polarization can be accomplished and by virtue of the symmetric arrangement of the antenna cross-polarization is annihilated.

As an independent validation, supplementary analyses by the finite integration technique (FIT) are also reported. Very close agreement is found between prescribed and synthesized array performance, which qualifies the proposed design approach as an accurate and effective tool for the synthesis of series-fed aperture-coupled patch arrays.},

Multiple reflections between radar and bumper can occur and may lead to a wrong estimation of the direction of arrival of the signal reflected by the target. This paper presents an effective solution to improve the hidden integration of radars in a vehicle. In particular, this paper proposes the design of a low-radar cross section (RCS) millimeter-wave antenna array to reduce the reflections toward the car fascia. The design exploits the properties of artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs) to cancel out the wave backscattered by the antenna array. The integration of the AMC with the antenna array is analyzed in detail. The experimental results prove that the array with low RCS can mitigate the multiple reflections. Moreover, the measurement results show that the proposed antenna has 20 dB RCS reduction at 76 GHz.},

The recent introduction of millimeter-wave RADARs with frequencies from 60 GHz to 300 GHz has broadened their potential applications thanks to their improved accuracy in angle, range, and velocity. MmWave FMCW RADARs have better resolution and accuracy than narrowband and ultra-wideband (UWB) RADARs. In comparison with cameras and LiDARs, they possess several strong advantages such as long-range perception, robustness to lightning, and weather conditions while being cheaper. However, their noisy and lower-density outputs even compared to other technologies of RADARs, and their ability to measure the targets’ velocities require specific algorithms tailored for them. Working principles of mmWave FMCW RADARs are presented as well as the separate ways to represent data and their applications. This paper describes algorithms and applications adapted or developed for these sensors in automotive applications. Finally, current challenges and directions for future works are presented.},

The unwanted effects range from interference over the radar channels, which causes amplitude fading and a corrupted direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, to the detection of ghost targets in an angle of arrival of the multipath direction. Due to the different number of reflections, polarimetric radars are capable to separate certain multipaths from direct paths if the target is known in advance. Furthermore, it is possible to separate objects with different polarimetric features in DOA that are located in the same radial distance to the radar. In this paper, a new approach to DOA detection based on the coherent Pauli decomposition is presented. With this approach, important multipath and DOA effects are analyzed and measurement results at 77 GHz on canonical objects in an anechoic chamber are presented. The results prove the feasibility of the approach and demonstrate the occurring effects.},

Typically, these systems operate using a single polarization. Fully polarimetric radars on the other hand are used to obtain the polarimetric scattering matrix (S-matrix) and extract polari-metric scattering information that otherwise remains concealed [2]. Combining both approaches by assembly of a dual-polarized waveguide antenna and a 77 GHz MIMO FMCW radar system results in the fully polarimetric MIMO radar system presented in this paper. By applying a MIMO-adapted version of the isolated antenna calibration technique (IACT) from [3], the radar system is calibrated and laboratory measurements of different canonical objects such as spheres, plates, dihedrals and trihedrals are performed. A statistical evaluation of these measurement results demonstrates the usability of the approach and shows that basic polarimetric scattering phenomena are reliably identified.},

These targets are mounted on a rotary table in an anechoic chamber and are rotated in front of a fully polarimetric radar operating at 77 GHz. For each rotation angle step, the targets are measured, where all measurements are taken at several distances. Then, a CNN is used to classify the measurement results into one of three superordinate classes of the constructed radar targets, each containing two different subordinate targets (sub-targets). Focus is lied on class decisions and not identification of specific sub-targets. A decision is taken for each single rotation angle step measurement and also for a majority vote on five consecutive rotation angle step measurements. Promising accuracy results demonstrate the validity of the approach but also reveal several open issues for future research.},

  abstract = {In upcoming years, the task of autonomous driving and the associated classification of road users will become increasingly important. For a robust classification, vehicle signatures that provide a set of independent physical scatter information about the vehicles are needed. Polarimetric radar cross section (RCS) object signatures offer the possibility to decompose the measured scattering matrix (S-matrix) into canonical scattering mechanisms, such as even- and odd-bounce, as well as crosspolar scattering. Classical single-polarized signatures, however, only depend on the co-polarized magnitudes and thus contain less information. Therefore, polarimetric RCS signatures are promising candidates for classification purposes. In this paper, polarimetric signatures at 77 GHz of four selected two-wheeled vehicle classes are presented. The test vehicles are rotated around their yaw axis and for each rotation angle step the range dependent polarimetric signature is measured. The polarimetric data is then processed by the coherent Pauli decomposition and the resulting signatures are presented. Furthermore, the polarimetric signatures are compared to their single-polarized versions.},

Today, millions of sensors are produced each year, which was made possible by inexpensive and mature millimeter wave technology. The technology maturity, in turn, enables research to be carried out on systems that are considerably more complex and powerful than was possible just a few years ago. The focus of research has thus shifted from purely hardware-oriented and device-level topics to sophisticated millimeter wave systems and RF signal processing topics. This opens up new research topics such as digital modulation schemes, radar networks, radar imaging, and machine learning. In this review paper, we sketch the path from the very beginning through the state of the art with sophisticated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays and mature assembly and interconnect concepts to today's key research topics of automotive radar.},

The procedure requires measurements of three known targets in order to determine the distortion matrices that characterize the effect of the measurement system on the transmitted and received waves. The scattering matrices for the known targets can be of any form, provided that a limited set of constraints is satisfied. A special case, wherein the transmit and receive distortion matrices are the transpose of each other, is considered. This case is useful for some single antenna systems and has the advantage that only two known targets are required.{$<>$}},

The modeling of these errors results in a 12-term error correction. The procedure for the error correction with three linear independent calibration targets and an isolation measurement is shown. Based on network analysis, a single reference calibration is introduced. This single reference calibration requires the precise calculation of only one reference target. As single references, spheres or flat plates are used. The references of the other targets are determined by the calibration procedure.

We consider the design of optimal polarizations at both the radar transmitter and receiver for the estimation of target scattering embedded in clutter. The goal is to minimize the mean squared error of the scattering estimation subject to an average radar pulse power constraint. Under the condition that the target and clutter scattering covariance matrices are known a priori, we show that such a problem is equivalent to the optimal design of a radar sensing matrix that contains the polarization information. We formulate the optimal design as a nonlinear optimization problem and then recast it in a convex form and is thus efficiently solvable by semi-definite programming (SDP). We compare the sensing performance of the optimally selected polarization over conventional approaches. Our numerical results demonstrate that a significant amount of power gain is achieved in the target scattering estimation through such an optimal design.},

This paper presents a numerical evaluation of the requirement for cross-polarization isolation from the data users' perspective, i.e., the quantitative impact of polarization cross talk on polarimetric target decomposition and the associated applications such as classification and detection. Sensitivity analyses of several commonly used target decomposition parameters suggest that a theoretical lower bound of −32 dB isolation level is preferred to avoid any significant impact on these parameters. Our analyses with both simulated and real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data show that a level of −25 dB would be acceptable for general terrain surface classification. This requirement is also true for man-made target detection application. Using simulated SAR images of man-made targets in natural environment, sensitivity analyses on two polarimetric detectors, Yang and Marino, both suggest that target detection performance would break down rapidly if isolation deteriorates from −25 dB to −20 dB.},

The covariance matrix approach is used to deal with the nonreflection symmetric scattering case. This scheme includes and extends the three-component decomposition method introduced by Freeman and Durden dealing with the reflection symmetry condition that the co-pol and the cross-pol correlations are close to zero. Helix scattering power is added as the fourth component to the three-component scattering model which describes surface, double bounce, and volume scattering. This helix scattering term is added to take account of the co-pol and the cross-pol correlations which generally appear in complex urban area scattering and disappear for a natural distributed scatterer. This term is relevant for describing man-made targets in urban area scattering. In addition, asymmetric volume scattering covariance matrices are introduced in dependence of the relative backscattering magnitude between HH and VV. A modification of probability density function for a cloud of dipole scatterers yields asymmetric covariance matrices. An appropriate choice among the symmetric or asymmetric volume scattering covariance matrices allows us to make a best fit to the measured data. A four-component decomposition algorithm is developed to deal with a general scattering case. The result of this decomposition is demonstrated with L-band Pi-SAR images taken over the city of Niigata, Japan.},

The array elements are arranged alternately and in opposite phases so that the unit radiation beams alternately point to two sides of the array. The wide-beam feature and the high gain performance are realized simultaneously by the array characteristics. The excellent beamwidth and antenna gain performance enable enormous application potential in automotive radar. An 8-unit prototype working at 24 GHz is designed and fabricated for automotive radar applications.

However, practical transceivers may involve antenna arrays with classical non-ideal factors (e.g., gain/phase/position errors) and polarimetric non-ideal factors (e.g., polarimetric antenna misorientation), and many current approaches cannot handle such non-ideal factors in real applications. In this study, polynomial rooting-based direction-of-arrival (DOA) and polarization parameter estimation is investigated for polarimetric monostatic MIMO radar with non-ideal transceivers. By incorporating the polarimetric manifold separation (PMS) technique, a joint DOA and polarization parameter estimation method, termed PMS2, is proposed with a closed-form solution. The Cramér-Rao bound for the multi-dimensional parameters involved in the estimation problem is also given. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed PMS2 approach, which is attributed to the compact structure of polarimetric transceivers and the ability of the PMS2 approach to handle the polarimetric properties of signals.},

Its geometry is very compact with aperture dimensions of 0.44 \textbackslash,łambda \_0 \textbackslash times 0.44\textbackslash, łambda \_0 and a profile depth of 0.64 \textbackslash,łambda ₀ . The proposed antenna system has full circular polarizations (CPs) at both the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) and comprises four layers with the ability to directly integrate into a radar front-end. High port isolation (≥35 dB) between adjacent Rx channels is achieved by using thin decoupling walls and dummy elements to suppress mutual couplings (MCs). The measured results show an excellent field of view (FoV) (embedded axial ratio ≤3 dB) in the azimuth plane, with about ±60° at Rx and ±50° at Tx. The antenna system is engineered for low radar cross section (RCS) target detection and offers suppression of environmental noise. Experimental evaluation of the integrated radar module shows good agreement between simulation and measurement results. The work offers potential applications of such antenna systems in automotive radar systems, especially where polarization diversity and environmental robustness are required.},

To leverage the full potential of multi-modal sensor suites, radar sensors are essential for safety critical tasks and are already installed in most new vehicles today. In this letter, we address the problem of semantic segmentation of moving objects in radar point clouds to enhance the perception of the environment with another sensor modality. Instead of aggregating multiple scans to densify the point clouds, we propose a novel approach based on the self-attention mechanism to accurately perform sparse, single-scan segmentation. Our approach, called Gaussian Radar Transformer, includes the newly introduced Gaussian transformer layer, which replaces the softmax normalization by a Gaussian function to decouple the contribution of individual points. To tackle the challenge of the transformer to capture long-range dependencies, we propose our attentive up- and downsampling modules to enlarge the receptive field and capture strong spatial relations. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art methods on the RadarScenes data set and show superior segmentation quality in diverse environments, even without exploiting temporal information.},

A novel extension of the calibration technique for off-broadside targets’ phase response is proposed by using an optimized progressive phase compensation. Rotated dihedral and trihedral targets are used for validation. On broadside, the standard deviation of the channels’ phase difference is nearly zero degrees for reference targets and under 5o for validation targets. The calibration for off-broadside targets shows that the phase relation in the target’s scattering matrix can be retrieved, the accuracy of which is dependent on the target’s type and angular position.},

Compared with the metal pyramid horn antenna, the Rogers 5880 dielectric substrate based on the SIW structure is used to form the horn structure and waveguide structure, which effectively reduces the difficulty of machining the antenna. The patch coupling feed structure provides a solution for integrating the SIW quasi-pyramid horn antenna with the radar chip. The proposed SIW quasi-pyramid horn antenna element achieves approximately 9 dBi realized gain, about 95\% radiation efficiency and 8.2 GHz bandwidth (74.1–82.3 GHz). A four-port inverting power divider was designed to verify the feasibility of forming an array with antenna elements. The designed antenna array achieves approximately 14.5 dBi realized gain, about 80\% radiation efficiency and 7.2 GHz bandwidth (74.3–81.5 GHz). Simulation and measurement results maintain good agreement for the antenna array. To further assess the impact of errors on the performance of the proposed antenna array, we have implemented a corresponding error analysis. The proposed antenna element and antenna array show promising potential for application in automotive radar systems.},

By controlling the states of four PIN diodes on the patch, the proposed antenna can produce linear polarization (LP), left- or right-hand circular polarization (LHCP or RHCP). For each polarization sense, the antenna exhibits wide impedance bandwidth, high gain and low cross-polarization. Two antennas are orthogonally placed to form a binary array for MIMO application, which has high isolation and low envelope correlation.

  abstract = {This paper represents a low-profile large-scale circular-polarized (CP) plate array antenna in the D-band. To achieve the high gain, high efficiency, and wideband at the same time, a CP 2 × 2 subarray antenna is proposed at first, consisting of integrated horns, complementary phase shifters, and a dual-polarized power divider (PD). The complementary phase shifter includes a parallel capacitance phase shifter and a parallel inductance phase shifter. Phase shifts generated by inductance and capacitance structures present opposite tendencies versus frequency. Therefore, an appropriate combination of them will make the phase shift almost constant over a wideband, which is important to generate a wideband CP beam. Besides, the capacitance phase shifter can be implemented by inserting irises at waveguide broadsides, while the inductance phase shifter can be achieved by inserting irises at the waveguide narrow side. Such a simple configuration can guarantee the element spacing limitation and the fabrication accuracy. The dual-polarized PD consists of an octagon cavity with rotated symmetrical coupling slots for wideband equal-amplitude and in-phase outputs. In addition, some matching layers and matching ridges in the octagon cavity are introduced to achieve wideband matching. Finally, a wideband array feeding network is used to build a 16 × 16-element left-handed CP array antenna. The S11 below -10 dB bandwidth is about 15.1\%, and the co-gain is more than 30 dBi from 130 to 149 GHz. The radiation efficiency is higher than 65\% and a 3 dB axial ratio can be satisfied over the whole band.},

In order to reduce the mutual coupling between AVA array elements, multiple notch structures are added on the ground plane.
